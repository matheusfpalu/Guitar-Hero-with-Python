# Guitar Hero Project

## Object Oriented Programming Final Project

## Project Description
The final project for the Object-Oriented Programming course had the following requirements:

1. **Programming Language and Paradigm:**
   - Mandatory use of the Python 3.X language.
   - Programming paradigm to be used: Object Orientation.

2. **Graphical Interface:**
   - Development of an executable graphic window in the Windows operating system.
   - Use of the Pygame library exclusively for game development.

3. **Manipulation of Graphic Elements:**
   - Manipulation and/or display of visual elements such as images, videos, animations, etc.

4. **Integration with External Hardware:**
   - Integration with external hardware, requiring communication and data manipulation.

## Solution Developed
To meet the proposed requirements, a game was created in Python using the Pygame library. The game is conceptually similar to the well-known "Guitar Hero" game, where the player must hit musical notes in sync with a soundtrack.

In addition, a Printed Circuit Board (PCB) was developed to enable integration with external hardware, in this case the Arduino. The Arduino Mega board was used for communication and control of the game, although the Arduino Uno could also be used for this purpose.

## Alternative version (without external hardware)
If external hardware is not available, an alternative version of the game has been created called "VERSÃ‚O_SEM_GUITARRA". In this version, you can control the game with the keys on your keyboard:
- "A" for the color Green,
- "S" for the color Red,
- "J" for Yellow and
- "K" for Blue.

In addition, the prototype guitar file is available in .step format. This file can be used to produce and implement the physical guitar, integrating it into the game for a more immersive experience.

Note: You will need to download all the files and perhaps change the directory of some.

## Conclusion
The project met the requirements proposed by the Object Oriented Programming course, integrating the Python language, the Object Orientation paradigm, the Pygame library for the game's graphical interface and communication with external hardware via Arduino. The alternative version allows the game to be enjoyed even in the absence of external hardware, and the prototype files offer the possibility of building and integrating a physical guitar into the game for a more complete experience.
